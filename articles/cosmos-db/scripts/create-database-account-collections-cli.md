# Azure Cosmos DB: Create an Azure Cosmos DB account by using CLI

This sample CLI script creates an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container for use with the DocumentDB, Table, or Graph APIs.  

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/create-cosmosdb-account-database/create-cosmosdb-account-database.sh?highlight=15-35 "Create an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
